## Summary

So I watched [this VSauce video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVq2ivVpZgQ) about the Monty Hall Problem and it was a good explanation of the problem which made me understand the problem better. However, I needed to EXPERIENCE it myself so I built this app to simulate the game being played to show that the chance of success increases when you switch rather than sticking with your first choice.
